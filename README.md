# Coloors
Coloors Project  |  The Creative Javascript Course

This project was developed using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript, to study how to implement the libraries. In this particular case, we used chroma.js.

We went through some topics, such as:

* selectors;
* events;
* functions;
* localStorage;
* libraries;

You can save the palette in localStorage to use whenever you want.

I'll implement some features, like a delete button in the palette save panel.
